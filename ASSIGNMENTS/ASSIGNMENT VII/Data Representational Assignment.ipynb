So we need to reduce the runtime complexity to something lower than O(n^2). \n",

    "## One possible approach can be to use the quicksort method of sorting to arramge the nuts and the bolts according to the size that is desired. in quicksort we will pick the last element as the pivot element and the we will arrange the nuts with the partition index 'part' such that the elements to the left of pivot are smaller than the pivot and elements to the right of pivot are larger than pivot. Similarly we can arrange the bolts as above. Therefore the overall complexity will be somewhat O(n log n) which is better than O(n^2). The quicksort algorithm that will be used will be as follows: "
